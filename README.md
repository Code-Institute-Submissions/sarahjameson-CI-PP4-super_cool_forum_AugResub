## Design

The look of this website is minimalist. I made this choice as I wanted the users mins to be free from any distracting design choices.

### Colour Scheme

- The colour scheme consists of black, gray and white throughout. Pops of colour are shown through the uses of emojis.

### Typography

- I use the default bootstrap fonts on the site as I find them very appealing as they are clean and easy to read.


### Wireframes

Wireframes for the project are linked here:

- [Link to repository with images](assets/images/wireframes/)
